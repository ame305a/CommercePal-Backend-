		<h4 class="title">MERCHANT SERVICES AGREEMENT</h4>
		<h4 class="orange">FACILITATED BY COMMERCEPAL SOLUTIONS, INC.</h4>

		<p>
			This Merchant Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between CommercePal and The Bank (Rays Microfinance or
			Other Institutions) and the undersigned Merchant (“Merchant, “you,” or “your”) in consideration of mutual
			promises. Bank and Merchant are independent parties contracting for services and neither is an agent,
			partner or joint venture of the other.
		</p>

		<h4 class="orange">
			INTRODUCTION
		</h4>

		<p>
			Merchant is engaged in the business of providing goods and/or services to customers and desires to accept
			credit and/or debit cards (“Cards”) bearing the name and logo of the Visa® or MasterCard® credit card
			associations or the issuer of any other Card of any association or network (collectively, the “Card
			Associations”) that Bank authorizes Merchant to accept as a means of payment for those goods and/or
			services. Bank is engaged in the business of providing for a fee electronic debit and credit card
			authorization, processing, data capture, deposit, clearing and settlement services.
		</p>

		<p>
			Merchant agrees to honor all valid Cards without discrimination and submit at the close of each business day
			all valid sales and credit slips (“Items”) for Card transactions for its business exclusively to Bank,
			according to the following terms and conditions, to which Bank and Merchant agree.
		</p>

		<h5 class="orange">
			1. OPERATING MANUAL
		</h5>

		<p>
			Merchant has received and reviewed an Operating Manual and other Attachments from Bank. These Attachments
			are a part of this Agreement. Bank and Merchant agree to the terms and conditions in the Operating Manual.
			For example, the Operating Manual contains a description of items subject to chargeback, certain promises
			and responsibilities of Merchant and other terms and conditions related to the processing of Card
			transactions, such as Merchant examining all Cards, obtaining authorization (for example, by “swiping” each
			Card) and obtaining authorization numbers for all Card transactions, and handling special situations (such
			as cardholder identification, sales without Cards, recovery of Cards upon request, returns and credits and
			recurring transactions). Transactions for any non-face-to-face transaction (e.g., Internet, mail, telephone
			and pre-authorized orders) are subject to special requirements specified in the Operating Manual. Merchant
			may not impose minimum or maximum amounts or surcharges for any Card transaction which are not imposed
			generally to its customer, for non-Card transactions.
		</p>

		<h5 class="orange">
			2. PROCESSING, SETTLEMENT AND OTHER SERVICES
		</h5>

		<p>
			Unless agreed by Bank in writing, Card transactions will be processed through Card Association networks via
			electronic authorization and data capture methods. Unless otherwise agreed by Bank, Merchant will balance
			and settle each terminal every business day. Transactions as one systems integrations that will comply with
			the Operating Regulations and Bank’s processing requirements. If required, Merchant has directly entered
			into a separate agreement with any Card Association(s) which allows Merchant to accept and process Card
			transactions. For all Card transactions (including debit cards, travel vouchers or lodging reservation
			service), the terms and conditions of all rules and regulations of Card Associations (the “Operating
			Regulations”) and the Operating Manual apply. Merchant agrees to those terms.
		</p>

		<h5 class="orange">
			3. ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION
		</h5>

		<p>
			Unless waived by a Card Association or Bank, you agree to adequately display the most current Card emblems,
			decals and other materials to inform the public that a Card(s) will be honored as required by the Operating
			Regulations. You shall only indicate that Cards are accepted and shall not indicate that any Card
			Association endorses your merchandise or services. While this Agreement is in effect, you shall make no
			other use of the emblems or marks of any Card Association or the Bank without our prior written consent. Any
			use of these emblems or marks will be in compliance with the Operating Regulations and specifications of the
			Card Associations and/or Bank. You will immediately discontinue use thereof upon direction of the Bank, or
			any Card Association and upon termination of this Agreement.
		</p>

		<h5 class="orange">
			4. ACCOUNTS
		</h5>

		<p>
			Settlement Account. You agree to designate and maintain an account (the “Settlement Account”) which accepts
			automated clearing house (“ACH”) transfers (which does not have to be a separate account, but may be
			commingled) with a balance of available funds sufficient to accommodate your obligations under this
			Agreement, either with us, or at an institution acceptable to us. If there are not sufficient available
			funds in the Settlement Account to cover your obligations, we may make deductions from payments due you from
			transactions. You agree to promptly pay us on demand for all amounts owed under this Agreement.
		</p>

		<p>
			Reserve Account. At any time and for any reason (including termination of this Agreement, unauthorized
			transactions, cessation of business, insolvency, excessive chargebacks, suspected or actual fraud, or
			competing claims), without giving prior notice, we reserve the right to require, and you agree to deposit
			and maintain such non-interest bearing accounts, additional funds or other security as we may require with
			us (which we may commingle with other funds), or at our sole discretion at a financial institution
			designated by us, in a reserve account (the “Reserve Account”) to be funded as specified by Bank, but within
			three (3) days, in amounts and upon such terms as determined by us in our sole discretion. In instances of
			unauthorized transactions, suspected or actual fraud or termination for cause, such Reserve Account funding
			may be immediate. We may also fund the Reserve Account with deductions from payments due you from
			transactions or by a charge against the Settlement Account or any other account. We will hold or be entitled
			to the funds in the Reserve Account until such time as we are satisfied that you have no further obligations
			under this Agreement. Your failure to fund the Reserve Account will result in immediate termination of this
			Agreement.
		</p>

		<h5 class="orange">
			5. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL ACCOUNTS
		</h5>

		<p>
			This Agreement and you authorize us to initiate and make deposits and withdrawals from any account which may
			be electronically transmitted or through an ACH or to delay or place holds on any amounts in such accounts
			in order to protect any of our rights and to obtain payment of any amount due us under this Agreement,
			including fees, charges and discounts without any further notice or demand. You will confirm to any
			institution holding any account the existence of this authorization and direct them to comply with our
			directions and you will not change any such confirmation or direction without our prior written consent. Any
			such confirmation, direction or authorization will remain in effect for at least 180 days after termination
			of this Agreement, or in our discretion, longer. We may, without notice, delay or stop making payments to
			you, set off, retain or otherwise hold (or direct your financial institution to place a hold) on any funds
			to protect ourselves against losses. Chargebacks, any amounts due or to become due under this Agreement, or
			based on your financial condition or in the event you submit transactions which are not authorized, do not
			conform to this Agreement, the Operating Manual, the Operating Regulations or applicable law including
			transactions subject to verification by any Card Association or cardholder. You agree that Bank will not be
			liable for any losses either direct or indirect due to holding of funds, suspension of processing,
			termination of this Agreement or any dishonor or any item as a result of these actions. You agree to
			promptly notify us of any discrepancy within 10 days of receipt of any statement regarding your accounts.
			Any account is subject to review, verification, acceptance and audit by Bank. Bank may return items to you
			for correction.
		</p>

		<p>
			YOU GRANT BANK A LIEN AND SECURITY INTEREST IN THE SETTLEMENT ACCOUNT, THE RESERVE ACCOUNT, ALL ITEMS
			(INCLUDING FUTURE ITEMS), ANY RIGHTS TO RECEIVE CREDITS OR PAYMENTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL DEPOSITS
			AND OTHER PROPERTY OF YOURS THAT BANK OR ITS AFFILIATES MAINTAIN (INCLUDING THE PROCEEDS THEREOF), AND YOU
			WILL EXECUTE, DELIVER ANY PAY THE FEES FOR ANY DOCUMENTS WE REQUEST TO CREATE, PERFECT, MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE
			THIS SECURITY INTEREST. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU IRREVOCABLY AUTHORIZE BANK TO EXECUTE ANY
			FINANCING STATEMENTS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS NECESSARY RELATED TO THIS SECURITY INTEREST.
		</p>

		<p>
			Merchant represents and warrants that no other person or entity has a security interest therein and that
			this security interest secures your obligations to us under this Agreement. Bank shall have all rights of a
			secured party and Merchant must obtain the prior written consent of Bank before granting any subsequent
			security interest. Merchant agrees that these accounts and secured property shall not be subject to any
			preference, claim, or stay by reason of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.
		</p>

		<h5 class="orange">
			6. CHARGEBACKS
		</h5>

		<p>
			We shall have the right, at any time and without notice, to charge back to you, and deduct, withdraw or
			set-off from payments due you from transactions or from the Settlement Account, the Reserve Account, any
			other account or from amounts due you, for the full amount of any
		</p>

		<p>
			Item designated by Bank or a Card Association or Card issuing bank which fails to meet the requirements of
			this Agreement, the Operating Manual, the Operating Regulations or applicable law (“Chargeback”). You agree
			to pay the amount of any Chargeback and the costs and expenses of the Bank (including investigations,
			retrieval and legal fees and costs) related to any item subject to:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Legal process (including reproduction of records)
			</li>
			<li>
				A bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding or
			</li>
			<li>
				Chargeback. If Bank or any Card Association determines or suspects any item to be questionable, it is
				subject to Chargeback. Bank shall retain any discount or fee related to a Chargeback transaction.
				Disputes relating to Chargebacks shall be governed by the Operating Regulations, including your
				obligation to provide required documentation.
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>

		<p>
			Merchant agrees to obtain authorization for all Card transactions. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that
			authorization for a Card transaction

		<ol>
			<li>
				indicates only the availability of credit at the time of the authorization
			</li>
			<li>
				Does not warrant that the person presenting the Card is the rightful cardholder, and
			</li>
			<li>
				Is not an unconditional guaranty by Bank that any Card transaction will not be subject to Charge back.
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>

		<h5 class="orange">
			7. MERCHANT INDEMNITY
		</h5>

		<p>
			In addition to any other indemnities in this Agreement (including the Operating Manual) or in the Operating
			Regulations, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold us and our affiliates (including officers, directors,
			employees, attorneys, shareholders, representatives and agents) harmless from and against any and all
			liabilities, judgments, arbitration awards, actions, suits, claims, demands, losses, damages, costs,
			expenses and attorneys’ fees, or fees in bankruptcy proceedings, incurred in connection with: (a) an item
			that does not conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Operating Manual, the Operating Regulations
			or applicable laws; (b) arising out of any Card transaction or any act or omission in connection with a
			cardholder; (c) a breach or an alleged breach of any item, covenant, condition, representation, warranty or
			agreement by you with any cardholder, any Card Association or to us, including your application to us, this
			Agreement, the Operating Manual and other Attachments, under the Operating Regulations or any violation of
			applicable laws; (d) the rescission, cancellation or avoidance of Card transaction or item, by operation of
			law, adjudication or otherwise; (e) any claim, counterclaim, complaint, dispute or defense, whether or not
			well-founded with respect to a Card transaction; or (f) damages, including death or injury caused by the
			good or service purchased with the Card.
